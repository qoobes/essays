# A site for my essay content

I am very aware of how bad this looks at the moment, though in my defense it is currently 4:01AM and I did overestimate my ability to not fall asleep, so it's a 10 minute project, which is why I didn't have time to use react with next.js to create a good looking website, and also why the routing is so bad. But it is what it is, I'll update it later. At least it works eh

So this is the list of all the available essays here, currently:

#### [Digital Design - 7th May 2020](https://essay.qoobes.me/stekki/creation "Digital Design - 7th May 2020")

And that's all there is.

I am 1000% sure i forgot something like really important but yeah.
